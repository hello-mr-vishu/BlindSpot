🔎 BlindSpot
Seeing what others miss.

A machine learning-powered phishing detection system that identifies malicious websites by 
analyzing hidden patterns in URLs and web metadata.
BlindSpot aims to catch threats that traditional filters and users often overlook.

phishing detection project "BlindSpot" because it reflects the core goal of the system
 — uncovering the hidden or overlooked threats that users typically miss. Just like how a blind spot
  in driving is a place the driver can’t see but can be dangerous, phishing links and deceptive 
  websites often hide in plain sight, bypassing human attention and even basic filters.

The name also ties in conceptually with machine learning, which is designed to detect subtle 
patterns and anomalies — essentially “seeing” into the user’s blind spot. 
I wanted a name that’s metaphorical but clear, with a professional tone that reflects both 
intelligence and vigilance. It’s short, memorable, and abstract enough to stand out in a portfolio 
or GitHub list, without being too literal like “PhishDetector.”

So in essence, BlindSpot isn’t just a name — it’s the very problem the project is solving.
